1,Update the system.
yum update -y 

2,install the redhat-upgrade-tool.beacuse redhat-upgrade-tool is not available 
on standard repositories,you must setup the repository to install it.

vi /etc/yum.repo.d/upgrade.repo
[upgrade]
name=upgrade
baseurl=http://dev.centos.org/centos/6/upg/x86_64/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0



3,install the follwing packages.
yum install preupgrade-assistant-contents redhat-upgrade-tool preupgrade-assistant

#preupgrade-assistant.x86_64 : Set of open source libraries enabling integration of the SCAP line of standards
#preupgrade-assistant-contents.noarch : Set of contents created by maintainers
#redhat-upgrade-tool.noarch : The CentOS Linux Upgrade tool


4,Run the following command to check to potential problem you might encounter with an upgrade from 
CentOS6 to CentOS7 before making a changes to the system

#preupg


5,We are going to use the repo file for the upgrade,issue the following command to import the GPG keyã€‚

#rpm --import http://mirrors.163.com/centos/7.2.1511/os/x86_64/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7




6,As per the man page,the following command is used to upgrade the Centos6;the will download the packages from the internet.

#redhat-upgrade-tool --network 7.2 --instrepo http://mirrors.163.com/centos/7.2.1511/os/x86_64/



7,But when i issued the command,it gave me the error to rerun the preupgrade-assistant again.
I tired multiple times but no luck.
When the following prompt when the shows a success

#setting up system for upgrade
#Finished. Reboot to start upgrade.



8,Now reboot the server

#reboot


9,The server will boot with the redhat-upgrade-tool kernel to upgrade the Centos6,
now you can find the up-gradation activity via console.
Now you can see the installation of the packages since the server reboot 

Once completed, you will get the login screen.
